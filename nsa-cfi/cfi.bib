  Abstract                 = {Publisher Summary Heap corruption bugs are just another face of buffer overflows. The simplest case of exploitation occurs when two allocated buffers are adjacent in memory and an attacker can supply some input that will overflow the first of these buffers. Afterward, the contents of the second buffer will be overwritten and when the program tries to use the data in the second buffer, it will use the one provided by an attacker. This is also true for statically allocated variables. More advanced methods of exploitation exist for the two most common implementations of malloc heap memory manager. Both lead to overwriting of an arbitrary location in memory with the attacker-supplied data. There are two ways of exploitation based on different steps of freeing the memory chunk: forward consolidation and backward consolidation. They require that an attacker create a fake memory chunk somewhere inside the buffer being overflowed. After that, this fake chunk is processed by free() and an overwrite occurs. Sometimes it is enough that an overflow overwrites only five (or even one) bytes of the second buffer. },
